# Sentinela

> Crowdsourced emergency reporting platform for community safety

Sentinela is a web application built by Darkmatter AI Labs (https://darkmatter.is) that enables citizens to report emergencies and disasters on an interactive map. Reports are validated by the community and can be sent to local government authorities.

## Purpose

Sentinela helps communities:
- Report incidents like fires, floods, earthquakes, landslides, storms, and road closures
- Validate reports through community voting (escalate/de-escalate)
- Visualize real-time environmental data from multiple sources
- Coordinate emergency response with local authorities

## How It Works

1. Citizens report incidents by pinning locations on an interactive map
2. Community members validate reports by voting
3. Reports reaching validation thresholds are sent to local government
4. Real-time data layers provide environmental context (weather, fires, earthquakes, etc.)

## Incident Types

- FLOOD - Flooding events
- FIRE - Fires and wildfires
- EXPLOSION - Explosions
- EARTHQUAKE - Seismic events
- LANDSLIDE - Landslides and mudslides
- STORM - Severe weather events
- ROAD_CLOSURE - Road blockages
- OTHER - Other emergencies
